        <h1>Factors influencing teachers’ technology adoption in technology-rich classrooms: model development and test</h1>
        <p>We know that technology is becoming increasingly important as time goes by, to the point where it is reaching the doors of education and beyond. The purpose of this article is to gather information about how technology is implemented by teachers in their classrooms and how it affects their teaching.</p>
        <p>Technology integration in teaching could increase learning efficiency and improve students’ digital literacy to help them adapt to the digital age</p>
        <p>Teachers faced challenges when implementing technology in their classrooms, such as time-consuming, lack of related resources and training, technology self-efficacy and beliefs about the value of technology. Recognizing these barriers will enable teachers to facilitate the integration of technology in the classroom, as they will be able to find solutions to them.</p>
        <p>This study has a few limitations. First, the research model in this study was designed to predict the technology adoption of teachers with multiple technologies available in their classrooms. It is possible that teachers without classroom technologies but who are interested in exploring suitable technologies by themselves may have different behavioral patterns, and future research is needed for this group of people. Second, the participants of this study were from the same city in China.</p>
        <p>The results may not be able to be generalizable to teachers in different locations. Future studies on a more diverse sample are needed to examine the behavior of different populations. Also, this study used a self-reported survey method. It is possible their answers are subjective and have potential misinterpretations. Further studies using methods that directly observe teachers’ technology use behavior and collect unstandardized data are needed.</p>
