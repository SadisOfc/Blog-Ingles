        <h1>Virtual reality in skill development through user experience and technology advancements</h1>
        <p>New technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) / Virtual Environment (VE), which focus on User Experience (UX) to provide more engaging and immersive experiences, can help people grow their skills. This study aims to explore the impact of VR technological advancements on skill development through UX design taxonomies using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Skill development classification was conducted based on social, emotional, and behavioral aspects.</p>

        <p>The study’s findings highlight the necessity of technology development for VR technology to accomplish UX for skill development, allowing them to become more self-sufficient. This research can enrich researchers and VR developers, particularly software, hardware, and artificial intelligence (AI) experts. More research should be conducted on the long-term use of VR as an assistive device, particularly for those seeking skill improvement to improve their quality of life.</p>

        <p>VR has emerged as a transformative technology that can be applied in various disciplines, including entertainment, education, healthcare, and business providing chances for learning, behavior change, and skill development.</p>
        <p>Here The value of VR for skill development stems from its unique capacity to imitate real-world scenarios, give hands-on instruction, and provide a safe environment for learners to practice and enhance their skills. As technology advances, VR is widely acknowledged as a vital asset in education, professional training, and personal development, with the potential to dramatically increase skill development and competence dramatically.</p>
