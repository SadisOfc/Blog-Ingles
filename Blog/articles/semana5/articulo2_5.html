        <h1>Tiny robots used to treat sensitive teeth</h1>
        <p>Tooth sensitivity affects millions of people worldwide, often limiting their ability to enjoy everyday activities like drinking cold water or eating ice cream. Traditional treatments, such as desensitizing toothpastes, only work on the surface and provide temporary relief. Now, groundbreaking research introduces a promising alternative: microscopic robots designed to penetrate deep into the tooth and provide lasting protection.</p>
        <p>According to a study published in Advanced Science, these nanorobots are capable of traveling 300–500 micrometres into the dentinal tubules—the microscopic channels that connect the outer enamel to the inner nerves. Once inside, the robots use a novel type of bioceramic cement to create solid plugs that block access to nerve endings. Unlike surface treatments, this method addresses the problem at its source.</p>

        <p>The technology was tested on extracted human teeth and later in animal trials. In mice with tooth sensitivity, treated teeth showed reduced pain responses: they preferred room temperature water over cold water, while healthy mice displayed no difference. The results suggest that this technique could effectively restore comfort and function for patients suffering from sensitivity.</p>
        <p>The researchers, including Debayan Dasgupta and Ambarish Ghosh, believe this innovation demonstrates the enormous potential of nanorobotics in healthcare. By offering a targeted, minimally invasive solution, these tiny robots could represent a major shift in dental treatments. Clinical trials will be the next step toward making this futuristic therapy available to patients.</p>
        <p>Nanorobotic technology may soon provide a durable, science-driven solution to tooth sensitivity, transforming both dental practice and patient quality of life.</p>
