        <h1>Russia and the Deployment of Warships to Venezuela</h1>
        <p>The article “Russia expresses its stance on the deployment of warships to Venezuela and sends a strong message” (Mundo Editorial, August 30, 2025) examines Russia’s official response to the rising tensions between Venezuela and the United States. The issue centers on the U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean and Venezuela’s request for international support, which has prompted the Kremlin to reiterate its solidarity with Nicolás Maduro’s government.</p>
        <p>According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Moscow rejects the use of force or threats against sovereign states as a tool of foreign policy. She emphasized Russia’s “solidarity” with both the Venezuelan government and its people, underlining their right to determine their political, economic, and social path free from external interference. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov further reinforced this position by directly conveying support to Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, highlighting the Kremlin’s commitment to safeguarding Venezuela’s sovereignty and institutional stability.</p>

        <p>This official statement must be understood in the broader context of Russia’s geopolitical strategy in Latin America. By defending Venezuela, Russia signals both its opposition to U.S. influence in the region and its interest in strengthening strategic partnerships. The article underscores Moscow’s appeal to the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention, and peace in the Western Hemisphere, citing the 2014 declaration of Latin America and the Caribbean as a “zone of peace” under the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Venezuela has denounced the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean as an “unprecedented level of threat” and has taken measures to reinforce its defense. This includes patrolling territorial waters with drones and naval vessels, as well as deploying 15,000 troops to the Colombian border, framed as part of anti-drug operations. These actions illustrate the Maduro administration’s attempt to project resilience while appealing to international law and institutions, notably the United Nations, to counter U.S. pressure.</p>
        <p>the article highlights how the Venezuelan crisis has become a focal point in global geopolitics, with Russia positioning itself as a defender of sovereignty and multipolar order, in direct contrast to U.S. interventionist policies. The episode not only reflects the fragility of regional stability in Latin America but also illustrates the extent to which global powers use such conflicts to reaffirm their influence and ideological commitments.</p>
