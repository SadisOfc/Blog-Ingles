        <p>The integration of advanced technology into agriculture is rapidly expanding. This development shows how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is moving from the lab to the farm. According to the article, this is part of a larger trend, as nearly 70% of large U.S. farms are already using some form of "precision farming," from autonomous tractors to GPS mapping.</p>
        <p>The core of this innovation lies in the specialized AI-powered collars, such as those produced by companies like Merck. These devices are equipped with sophisticated motion sensors that continuously gather data from each animal. This constant stream of information feeds an advanced machine learning algorithm, allowing the system to track subtle biological indicators far beyond the capability of human observation.</p>
        <p>The key benefit highlighted in the article is the predictive health monitoring. The system is trained to closely track metrics like the cow's chewing patterns and the time spent on digestion. By identifying even minor deviations or "signatures" in this data, the algorithm can detect potential health issues and illnesses before the animal shows any outward, physical symptoms. This ability allows farmers to make preventive adjustments to the animal's feed or administer early treatment, which drastically improves herd efficiency and welfare.</p>
        <p>This technology transforms livestock management into a data science. While the practical outcome is clear optimizing production and potentially improving animal health, it raises important ethical questions. We must consider whether this level of biological tracking represents a natural evolution in animal care or the beginning of total biological surveillance, where every life function is constantly monitored and managed by an algorithm for economic purposes.</p>
