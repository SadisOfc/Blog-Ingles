        <h1>The controversial proposal to automatically scan private messages threatens privacy and could set a global precedent</h1>
        <p>A few days ago, the debate was resumed on a measure that is being considered for implementation across the nations of the European Union, known as “Chat Control.” It is a legislative proposal that would function as a regulation to combat online child sexual abuse, requiring technology companies to automatically scan all messages, photos, videos, and files sent by users, even on applications that use end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram. The declared objective is to detect and report material related to child abuse.</p>
        <p>Out of the 27 EU member countries, 15 have shown support for the measure, 3 have expressed opposition, and the rest remain undecided. Although the proposal is not new —it was already presented in 2022 and rejected for conflicting with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and privacy regulations— this new attempt seeks to overcome previous legal obstacles.</p>

        <p>While the intention to protect minors is legitimate, the practical implementation of Chat Control raises significant challenges and risks. Breaking the encryption of applications not only undermines users’ privacy, but also requires handling enormous amounts of sensitive information, with highly complex technical structures and security systems to prevent leaks, hacks, or misuse of the data.</p>
        <p>The use of automatic scanning also increases the risk of false positives, where innocent people could be identified as suspicious. This would not only affect citizens but could also overwhelm investigative systems and hinder the work of authorities.</p>
        <p>Another critical point is the exemption of politicians and prominent individuals from these scans. This raises concerns about fairness and the potential use of the data for social control or political manipulation. If implemented across all EU countries, the measure would set a global precedent, potentially inspiring similar legislation outside of Europe, even in nations with lower transparency and higher levels of corruption.</p>

        <p>In response to this proposal, digital rights organizations and privacy advocates have launched the <a href="https://fightchatcontrol.eu/">Fight Chat Control</a> campaign. This initiative aims to raise awareness among citizens about the risks of mass message scanning and to pressure legislators to reconsider the measure. The campaign emphasizes that Chat Control would not only compromise user privacy but could also set a dangerous precedent for global surveillance, especially in countries with weaker digital rights protections. Additionally, it promotes education on safer and more effective alternatives to protect minors without compromising the privacy of all citizens.</p>
        <p>Although the declared goal of Chat Control is to protect children, the risks associated with privacy, technical security, and potential misuse of information raise serious doubts about its viability and appropriateness. The proposal could become a model of mass surveillance with deep social and political implications, extending far beyond its original purpose.</p>
