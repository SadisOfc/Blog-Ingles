        <h1>Russia has not created a cure for cancer: what is really known about the experimental vaccine</h1>
        <p>In recent days, a supposed news story has gone viral on social media claiming that Russia has developed a vaccine capable of curing cancer and that it would be available worldwide in 2025. However, that information is false. Although the expectation generated is high, the reality is that the medicine mentioned is still in a very early stage of development and can’t be considered a definitive cure.</p>
        <p>The drug in question is being developed by the National Gamaleya Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, the same institution responsible for the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. According to its director, Alexander Gunzburg, tests carried out on mice showed the disappearance of both the tumor and the metastasis after applying this experimental vaccine based on messenger RNA technology. These results have encouraged the planning of human clinical trials, which are expected to begin towards the end of 2025 in some oncology centers in Russia.</p>

        <p>Although this represents a promising advance, it is not correct to speak of a cure or of an immediate distribution. The studies made public so far correspond only to the preclinical phase, an initial stage of research in which many drugs fail to advance to further stages. Effectiveness in animals does not guarantee that the treatment will work the same way in humans, nor that it will be safe.</p>
        <p>In addition, several scenes from the videos circulating on social media to illustrate the supposed news were created with artificial intelligence, which confirms the misleading nature of these publications. Fact-checking organizations such as Chequeado and La República have debunked the viral versions, stressing that the vaccine is not ready and will not be released to the market in 2025.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, what is real is that Russia is working on an experimental cancer vaccine that has shown positive results in laboratory tests. What is false is that there is already a cure available or that the medicine will be distributed worldwide in the short term. Research is still underway, but there is a long way to go before it can be considered an effective treatment for this disease.</p>
