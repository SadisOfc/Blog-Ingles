        <p>The terrorist attack against the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, in New York was an event that not only caused worldwide chaos, but also left a deep void in thousands of families who longed for the bodies of their loved ones to be at least recognized and returned for a final farewell.</p>

        <p>This was the case of Barbara Keating, a 72 years old woman who was on American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to crash into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Along with nearly 3,000 people, she lost her life in this tragedy. For more than two decades, her remains could not be identified, and she was among the 1,100 victims whose bodies were never recovered or recognized.</p>

        <p>Barbara was remembered as a devoted mother of five and a loving grandmother. She had overcome serious challenges in life, including two battles with breast cancer and the loss of her husband to a brain tumor, yet she always remained strong and compassionate. Beyond her family, she was deeply committed to social causes, serving as director of organizations that supported children and people with disabilities.</p>

        <p>After 24 years, advances in DNA analysis finally allowed authorities to identify her remains, bringing a sense of closure to her family.</p>
        
        <p>Today, part of her remains will rest at the World Trade Center Memorial, together with those of other victims, as an eternal symbol of memory and resilience, while the rest will be buried alongside her husband. In this way, Barbara’s story will forever be linked to one of the darkest moments in modern history. </p>
