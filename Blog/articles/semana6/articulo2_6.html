        <p>ChatGPT is a revolutionary tool that, throughout the years it has been active, has shown great versatility. However, that same flexibility has led some people to try to use it as a substitute for certain human roles, such as in this case, the role of a psychologist.</p>

        <p>Because many young people suffering from depression used it as emotional support and (considering that the tool has neither feelings nor the same capacity for empathy and analysis as a mental health professional) some of them, in extreme situations, ended up taking their own lives after receiving alleged “instructions” from the AI. Families have stated that these events occurred due to direct influence from the system, although OpenAI spokespersons explain that the longer the conversations and the more memory is stored, the less effective the warnings become that are supposed to redirect users in crisis to official mental health and support channels.</p>

        <p>Although the company does not acknowledge these cases as direct implications of the tool, OpenAI recently announced the upcoming release of parental control features. With them, parents will be able to link their accounts to those of their teenage children and receive alerts in case of risky conversations or situations. These measures have been well received by many families, although they represent a major challenge for the company, which must now anticipate behaviors that, ultimately, are also the responsibility of parents.</p>
