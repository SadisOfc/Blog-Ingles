          <h1>How language is hiding the real internet from you</h1>
          <p>We might believe that all the information on Google, or on the internet in general, is within everyone’s reach. However, the algorithms we use are fed by everything we search for, and this ends up creating invisible filters. Even though internet access is public, a lot of information remains hidden because of language.</p>
          <p>This blind spot that exists between the internet and our language is so big that some pages lose their original purpose or even end up being the opposite of what some users expect. A clear example is LiveJournal: in Russia, it was a space to express opinions, discuss politics, and hold public debates, while in the USA, many teenagers used it to talk about their youth, hobbies, and entertainment topics.</p>
          <p>One of the main studies that supports this idea was presented by the BBC news channel. Based on the invisible filter reinforced by our language, they made a comparison between the main languages on the YouTube platform: English (the native language of many users on this platform and the one with the most content creators), Spanish, Russian, and Hindi.</p>
          <p>Before obtaining any results, it was considered that culture could influence the interactions and behavior of users in each region. This is how India surprised the researchers: despite being known for its music and warmth, it adopted the YouTube Shorts model more than other countries. This feature, often considered irrelevant or even seen as a copy of TikTok, gained traction after TikTok was banned in India, as creators began using the same format in Shorts, with videos of up to 30 seconds in length.</p>
          <p>This analysis not only showed us that there are different approaches depending on the region and culture, but also that language is what shapes the filter through wich the internet is presented to us.</p>
