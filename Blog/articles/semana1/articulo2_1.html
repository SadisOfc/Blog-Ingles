          <h1>Discord between Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to stop the war</h1>
          <p>The tension between the two countries has produced one of the most chaotic wars of the last decade, harming both countries, although Ukraine seems more affected than its forceful Russian adversary. The allies of each nation seek a ceasefire, but it seems that neither side has that purpose.</p>
          <p>Ahead of Putin’s visit to Trump in Alaska, Ukraine’s president, Zelensky, stated that Trump’s willingness to organize a summit was null. On the other hand, President Putin argued that his flexibility was greater than that of the Ukrainian leader, since all his requests and attempts at meetings were denied.</p>
          <p>After the attempts of U.S. President Donald Trump to act as an intermediary in the summit between both countries, Russia seems not to consider Ukraine as a decisive factor in its decisions or in the resolution of the armed conflict. Meanwhile, Ukraine asks NATO to apply the fifth rule, where an attack is considered an attack against the entire organization.</p>
          <p>It looks like both countries don’t have the initiative to stop the conflict, given that the attacks haven’t ceased despite the allies’ attempts to minimize the situation. The most harmed continue to be the citizens and neighboring countries, who depend on the resources provided by these nations. </p>
